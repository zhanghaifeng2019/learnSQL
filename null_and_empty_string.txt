I've a table where some rows have some blank cells. 
I tried to select such rows using IS NULL function. But the query select 0 rows.

select * from zzz_fkp_registration_female where fname is null;


Now I changed my query to:

select * from zzz_fkp_registration_female where fname is null or fname ='';

I got the desired result.

在数据库中null跟空字符串是被严格区分的。
但是在php中var_dump(null==""); 显示的是true。


Some differences between them:

NULL can be assigned to any type, as opposed to empty string which won't be compatible with date/numerical fields.

NULL is an UNKNOWN value, it doesn't have a value as opposed to an empty string, which is a value, but empty one.

As far as I'm aware of, NULL shouldn't capture memory as opposed to an empty string which does.

null = null will result in null as opposed to ''='' which will result in TRUE.


Some more differences:

A LENGTH of NULL is NULL, 
a LENGTH of an empty string is 0. 
NULLs are sorted before the empty strings. 
COUNT(message) will count empty strings but not NULLs 
You can search for an empty string using a bound variable but not for a NULL. 

This query:   SELECT  * FROM    mytable    WHERE   mytext = ?

will never match a NULL in mytext, 
whatever value you pass from the client. 
To match NULLs, you'll have to use other query

SELECT  *  FROM    mytable  WHERE   mytext IS NULL
